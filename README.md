SecuraMem (smem): Air‚ÄëGapped Code Memory CLI for Audit & Compliance
Verifiable, secure, and human-in-control code memory for regulated environments.

Overview
SecuraMem (smem) is an air-gapped, AI-agnostic persistent memory tool designed for backend, infrastructure, and regulated teams (finance, healthcare, defense, enterprise). Everything runs locally‚Äîno telemetry, zero network egress‚Äîwith reproducible builds, signed artifacts, SBOMs, and a glass-box audit trail for full compliance.

Audit-first architecture: All commands, code edits, and (optional) AI invocations are timestamped, journaled, and fully traceable.

Human-centric control: AI can never run init (or other critical actions) without explicit developer override.

Automatic code indexing & purging: Context stays fresh; old memory is safely pruned as projects evolve.

Import/export with cryptographic signatures and checksums: Portable and verifiable state for offline workflows.

Extensive user guide: Use smem as a pure human-controlled tool‚ÄîAI is strictly optional.

Immutable receipts, live status, policy enforcement: Every change is logged, signed, and available for compliance review.

Quick Features
- Air-gapped, local-only storage
- Full audit/history log (searchable by timestamp/action)
- No vendor lock-in; AI integrations are pluggable and optional
- SBOM generation and fully reproducible builds
- Signed exports and integrity verification on import
- Green build status, complete test coverage
- Policy configuration, status printouts (e.g., trust tokens, signing precedence)
- $5/month honor system: Pro features for advanced workflows; free core is never crippled

Why SecuraMem?
For devs and teams in sensitive and compliance-driven environments, SecuraMem gives ironclad control and transparency‚Äîfar beyond what typical cloud/vendor CLI tools offer. It‚Äôs designed for those who need proof, not just convenience.

Getting Started
See [USER_GUIDE.md] for complete install and usage.
Or run:

```bash
smem help
```

Feel free to adapt, expand, or trim as needed‚Äîthe goal is to make everyone landing on smem-cli instantly realize this is serious infra, built for compliance and control.
# üß† CodeContextPro (cctx)

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-%E2%9D%A4-ff69b4?style=flat&logo=github%20sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/jahboukie)

Air‚Äëgapped, zero‚Äëtrust persistent memory CLI for AI agents and developers.

CodeContextPro (cctx) makes code context and decisions durable, auditable, and portable without relying on any cloud services. It‚Äôs built for regulated and offline environments where transparency, audit, and operator control are non‚Äënegotiable.

For pricing details and the honor‚Äësystem approach, see: docs/pricing.md

## Why CodeContextPro

- Zero‚Äëtrust by default: command and file access must be explicitly allowed, with an audit trail.
- Glassbox operations: plan/mirror/explain/dry‚Äërun on every command, receipts + journal + digests.
- Code‚Äëaware recall: index code by files or symbols with Tree-sitter precision parsing, search via FTS and hybrid vector rerank (sqlite‚Äëvss fallback safe).
 - Diff‚Äëaware reindex: cache file digests; skip unchanged files with `--diff` (baseline cache built automatically).
- Tree-sitter AST parsing: Precise symbol boundary detection for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python with graceful fallback.
- Air‚Äëgapped protocol: export/import portable context bundles (.cctxctx) for offline transfer.
- Enterprise security suite: Cryptographic signing, audit logging, MFA support, SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA compliance ready.

## Quick start (CLI = `cctx`)

```powershell
# Install globally
npm install -g codecontextpro

# Initialize in your project (creates .codecontextpro/)
cctx init

# Index code (symbol-aware) and search
cctx index-code --symbols --path .
cctx search-code "functionName" --hybrid --preview 3 --trace

# Inspect receipts and journal
cctx receipt-show --last
cctx journal --show
```

Tip: If something is blocked by policy, CodeContextPro will explain and show a one‚Äëliner fix. You can also run:

```powershell
cctx policy doctor --cmd index-code --path .
cctx policy allow-path ./**
```

## Core features

- Transparency & Operator Parity
	- Global flags: `--trace`, `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--explain`
	- Receipts: `.codecontextpro/receipts/*.json` with digests
	- Journal: `.codecontextpro/journal.jsonl`

- Zero‚ÄëTrust Policy Broker (local, auditable)
	- `cctx policy status` ‚Äî show effective rules
	- `cctx policy allow-command <cmd>` ‚Äî permit a command
	- `cctx policy allow-path <glob>` ‚Äî permit a path
	- `cctx policy doctor [--cmd] [--path]` ‚Äî explain pass/fail and print the fix
	- `cctx policy trust <cmd> --minutes 15` ‚Äî short‚Äëlived dev convenience token

- Code‚Äëaware Index & Search
	- `cctx index-code [--symbols] [--path .] [--include ...] [--exclude ...]`
		- Add `--diff` to skip unchanged files after an initial baseline run.
	- `cctx search-code <query> [-k N] [--preview N] [--hybrid] [--filter-path ...]`
	- Hybrid FTS + vector rerank; sqlite‚Äëvss when available, otherwise local cosine fallback

- Air‚ÄëGapped Context (.cctxctx)
		- `smem export-context --out ./ctx.smemctx --type code [--zip] [--sign]`
		- `smem import-context ./ctx.smemctx[.zip]` (verification + receipts)
	- Exports now include: `manifest.json`, `map.csv`, `vectors.f32`, `notes.jsonl`, `checksums.json`, optional `signature.bin` + `publickey.der` (if signed)
	- Supports zipped bundle (`ctx.cctxctx.zip`) with identical verification logic
	- Deterministic integrity & exit codes (see Status / Air‚Äëgapped integrity)

## Status (v1.8.0)

Legend: ‚úÖ shipped ¬∑ ‚ñ∂ partial ¬∑ ‚è≥ planned ¬∑ üí§ deferred

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Transparency (trace, dry-run, receipts, journal, plan/mirror) | ‚úÖ | Receipts include verification + hybrid extras |
| Zero‚Äëtrust policy broker | ‚úÖ | allow-command/path, doctor, trust tokens |
| Code indexing (file + Tree-sitter symbols) | ‚úÖ | AST-based precision parsing for TS/JS/Python with heuristic fallback |
| Hybrid search (FTS + vector rerank) | ‚úÖ | ANN acceleration roadmap |
| Air‚Äëgapped export/import | ‚úÖ | Dir or zip, per‚Äëfile checksums, signing, provenance |
| Per‚Äëfile checksums + precedence | ‚úÖ | Exit 4 checksum > signature mismatch |
| Signing & key rotation/archive | ‚úÖ | key rotate/status/list/prune; archived keys stored |
| Provenance metadata | ‚úÖ | Exporter version/node/host + keyId in manifest |
| Path redaction guard | ‚úÖ | Removes sensitive absolute prefixes in receipts |
| Replay (basic) | ‚ñ∂ | Time‚Äëtravel deferred |
| Usage-based nudges | ‚è≥ | usage.json scaffold not yet |
| Tree‚Äësitter precision | ‚úÖ | AST-based symbol extraction for TypeScript/JavaScript/Python |
| ANN / approximate vectors | ‚è≥ | Next performance upgrade after Tree-sitter |
| Merge/diff import preview | ‚è≥ | Pro feature roadmap |
| Time-travel replay | üí§ | Post ANN + symbol precision |

Integrity Exit Codes (import-context):
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 2 | Blocked: unsigned bundle (policy requires signature) |
| 3 | Invalid signature (cryptographic failure) |
| 4 | Checksum mismatch (file tampered/corrupt) |

Symbol Mode: Tree-sitter AST parsing provides precise language-aware symbol segmentation for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python. Falls back to heuristic parsing when Tree-sitter is unavailable. Significantly improves recall accuracy over regex-based approaches.

ANN Acceleration: Present build uses deterministic local cosine fallback when sqlite‚Äëvss not available. ANN / approximate recall arrives post v1.8.0; no network calls will be introduced.

Security Note: See SECURITY.md for the zero‚Äëegress posture, signing model, and policy threat boundaries.

## Security model (local‚Äëonly by default)

- No network egress for core operations; all data lives in `.codecontextpro/` and is encrypted at rest by default.
- Policy‚Äëenforced command and path access with audit log (`.codecontextpro/audit.log`).
- Clear remediation when blocked: CodeContextPro prints the exact `cctx policy ...` fix.

## Command reference (selected)

- Project & status
	- `cctx init` ‚Äî initialize project
	- `cctx status` ‚Äî project/memory stats
	- `cctx vector-status` ‚Äî vector backend info

- Index & search
	- `cctx index-code` ‚Äî index code into memory
	- `cctx search-code` ‚Äî search indexed chunks

- Transparency & replay
	- `cctx receipt-show [--last]` ‚Äî pretty‚Äëprint a receipt
	- `cctx journal --show|--clear` ‚Äî view or clear journal
	- `cctx replay --last|--range N [--dry-run]` ‚Äî safe replays (prototype)

- Policy
	- `cctx policy status|doctor|allow-command|allow-path|trust`

- Proofs
	- `cctx prove-offline [--json]` ‚Äî explicit no‚Äëegress proof line for audits

- Air‚Äëgapped
	- `cctx export-context` and `cctx import-context`

- Maintenance & Recovery
	- `cctx db-doctor` ‚Äî integrity check + automatic repair (backs up corrupted file then rebuilds schema)
	- `cctx digest-cache --list|--clear` ‚Äî inspect or reset file digest cache used by `--diff`

## Roadmap highlights
