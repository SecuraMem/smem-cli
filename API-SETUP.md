## Step 1: Prepare Your API for Public Consumption
Your existing API is the core asset, but it needs to be polished for external business customers.

API Documentation (The #1 Priority): No developer can use an API they can't understand. You must create comprehensive, professional documentation.

Recommendation: Use a standard like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger). You can write a spec file that defines every endpoint, its parameters, and its responses. Tools like Swagger UI or Redoc can then generate a beautiful, interactive documentation website from that file.



Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on your API to prevent any single partner from overwhelming your system through abuse or a runaway script. You can implement this in your Firebase Functions or use a service like Cloudflare.


Robust Error Handling: Ensure your API returns the standardized, clear error codes and messages we designed for every possible failure scenario.

## Step 2: Build a Developer Portal
This will be the "front door" for your PaaS customers. It's a dedicated section of your website, likely living at a subdomain like developer.codecontext.pro.

Its key components are:

Self-Service Signup: A page where businesses can view your API plans (e.g., Growth, Business, Scale) and subscribe.

API Key Management: A secure dashboard where an authenticated business customer can generate new API keys, view their existing keys, and revoke old ones.

Usage Analytics: A dashboard that shows them their API call volume over time, so they can track their usage against their plan's limits.

Documentation: This portal will host the beautiful API documentation you created in Step 1.

Billing Portal: A link to their Stripe Customer Portal where they can manage their subscription, update their payment method, and view past invoices.

## Step 3: Implement B2B Authentication & Billing
This is different from your retail flow. It needs to handle organizations, not just individual users.

Authentication Model: In Firestore, you'll create a new top-level collection called organizations. When a business like Replit signs up, you create a document for them. This document will be linked to their subscription and will contain a list of their authorized users and API keys. This allows them to manage their team's access centrally.

Billing with Stripe Billing: Your retail Stripe Payment Links are not suitable for this. You'll use Stripe's core subscription product.

In your Stripe Dashboard, create new "Products" and "Prices" for your API plans (e.g., a $5,000/month price).

When a business subscribes through your developer portal, your backend uses the Stripe API to create a Customer object for them, and then a Subscription that links the customer to the correct price.

Stripe then handles the recurring monthly or annual invoicing automatically.

## Step 4: Provide Professional Support & a Status Page
Businesses paying thousands of dollars a month expect a higher level of support.

Tiered Support: Offer different support levels. The base plan might get email support, while higher tiers get a shared Slack channel for direct access to you or your future support team.

Public Status Page: Use a service like Atlassian Statuspage or Instatus to create a public status page (e.g., status.codecontext.pro). This page will automatically reflect the uptime of your API. It builds immense trust and transparency with your business customers.

Recommendation: A Phased Rollout
As a solo developer, do not try to build all of this at once.

Start Manually: Handle your first one or two partners (like Replit) manually. Talk to them directly, create their organization and API key in your database yourself, and send them a Stripe Invoice.

Validate Demand: Use the revenue and feedback from these initial partners to prove there is a market for your PaaS offering.

Build the Portal: Once the model is proven, use the revenue you've earned to invest the time in building the automated, self-service developer portal described above.
