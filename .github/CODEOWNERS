# CODEOWNERS
#
# GitHub uses this file to auto-request reviews. Owners must be GitHub users or teams in your org (e.g., @SecuraMem/maintainers).
# Adjust the team names below to match your organization.
# If youâ€™re a solo maintainer, replace teams with your GitHub username (e.g., @jahboukie).

# Default ownership: route all reviews to the SecuraMem org
*                               @SecuraMem
